# US RoadSafe Analytics

## Project Introduction

Road accidents represent a significant public safety challenge in the United States, causing substantial loss of life, injuries, and economic burden annually. Understanding the underlying patterns and contributing factors to these accidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and improving transportation infrastructure. The **RoadSafe Analytics** project addresses this critical need through comprehensive data-driven analysis.

This project leverages advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to examine a large-scale dataset of over 4 million road accident records from across the United States. By systematically analyzing accident patterns across temporal, spatial, environmental, and severity dimensions, the project aims to extract actionable insights that can inform policy decisions, guide infrastructure investments, and support public safety initiatives.

Using Python-based data science tools including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis transforms raw accident data into meaningful intelligence about when, where, and under what conditions accidents occur, and what factors contribute to their severity. The findings serve as an evidence base for stakeholders including transportation authorities, urban planners, policy makers, and safety advocates.

## Project Statement

The primary goal of this project is to analyze a large dataset of road accidents to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity. The project involves performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for statistical visualization, and Streamlit for developing an interactive dashboard to extract meaningful insights that can help improve road safety across the United States.

## Stepwise Pipeline Structure

### Initial Data

- Loaded from CSV file (example: `US_Accidents_March23.csv`)
- Original data shape: millions of rows, approximately 47 columns
- Notable missing data mainly in weather features and geographic details


### Duplicate Records Removal

- Duplicates eliminated based on unique `"ID"` field
- Several thousand duplicate entries dropped to ensure uniqueness


### Columns with High Missing Data Dropped

- Only **`End_Lat`** and **`End_Lng`** columns were dropped due to >44% missing values
- Other columns with missing data were imputed rather than dropped


### Non-Analytical Text/ID Columns Removed

- Columns such as `"ID"`, `"Source"`, `"Description"`, `"Street"`, `"Country"`, `"Zipcode"`, `"Timezone"`, `"Airport_Code"`, and `"Amenity"` were removed to reduce noise and focus on analytical features


### Temporal Columns Cleaning

- Converted `"Start_Time"` and `"End_Time"` to datetime objects with error coercion
- Rows with invalid timestamps were removed for data quality


### Geographic Coordinates Cleaning

- Latitude and Longitude columns (`"Start_Lat"`, `"Start_Lng"`) converted to numeric types
- Renamed to `"Latitude"` and `"Longitude"`
- Rows with missing or invalid coordinates were dropped


### Severity Filtering

- Kept only records where `"Severity"` is 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Outliers or invalid severity levels removed


### Minor Missing Data Rows Removed

- Columns with low missingness (0‚Äì3%) were identified
- Rows missing data in those columns were dropped for increased data purity


### Weather Feature Imputation

- **`Wind_Speed(mph)`**: Median imputation for missing values to maintain robustness
- **`Precipitation(in)`**: Missing values filled with 0.0, assuming no precipitation
- **`Wind_Chill(F)`**: Missing values predicted by linear regression model trained on weather-related features (`Wind_Speed(mph)`, `Temperature(F)`, `Humidity(%)`)


### Numeric Imputation

- Remaining numeric columns with missing values filled using median imputation


### Temporal Feature Engineering

- Created the following new features:
    - `Duration_Minutes`: Difference between `"End_Time"` and `"Start_Time"` in minutes
    - `Year`: Extracted from `"Start_Time"`
    - `Hour`: Hour of day from `"Start_Time"`
    - `DayOfWeek`: Weekday extracted from `"Start_Time"`
    - `Month`: Month extracted from `"Start_Time"`
    - `IsWeekend`: Binary indicator if day is Saturday or Sunday


### Categorical Encoding

- Boolean columns (`"Roundabout"`, `"Station"`, `"Stop"`, `"Traffic_Calming"`, `"Traffic_Signal"`, `"Turning_Loop"`) converted to integer (0/1)
- `"Sunrise_Sunset"` column converted to binary `"IsDay"` feature (Day=1, Night=0)


### Redundant Temporal/Weather Columns Dropped

- Columns removed after feature engineering to avoid redundancy:
    - `"Start_Time"`, `"End_Time"`
    - `"Weather_Timestamp"`
    - Twilight indicators: `"Civil_Twilight"`, `"Nautical_Twilight"`, `"Astronomical_Twilight"`
    - Original `"Sunrise_Sunset"`


### Final Cleanup

- Any remaining rows with `NaN` values across any feature removed to ensure a complete dataset


### Data Export

- Final, cleaned dataframe saved as CSV at user-specified path
- Typical final dataset shape: ~ 6.9 millions of rows, 35 columns with no missing values
